# Overview
Repository with solutions for practice questions from various sites (leetcode, hackerrank, etc.)

# Motivation
As workloads become more AI-centric, my own sharpness in terms of algorithmic thinking seems to be slipping away. So I'll be doing these practice problems to keep my programmer muscles fit.

# Languages Used

## What I Use IRL
- In my daily webdev life, I use Php and TypeScript about half of the time each. I have done a couple of web projects in Rust that are in production.
- In my personal life, I have used C++ a lot and C# extensively for gamedev. I really enjoy coding in Rust.
- I have recently (Jan 24, 26) started taking an interest in Elixir.

## Plan
- Do all problems in Rust first to exercise solving the problem itself 
- Do these problems in Elixir or C++ later to exercise coding in these languages. Not all leetcode problems support elixir.
- Do the problems in Php/TS to kill time
