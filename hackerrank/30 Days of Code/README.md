30 days of code is ridiculously easy. But it gives you a badge and boy do I like dopamine.

Although, since it's easy, it's a good way to practice some basic C++. I had used C++17 for a couple of years in college and had become quite proficient with it, but most of that is gone now. Also, HackerRank support for my other favored languages (rust and elixir) is quite limited.
